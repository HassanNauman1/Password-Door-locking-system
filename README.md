# Password-Door-locking-system
The Password-Based Door Lock System is a security project that uses an  Arduino microcontroller to control access through a 4x4 keypad. Users must  enter a correct password to unlock a servo motor that simulates a locking  mechanism. If the password is incorrect, access is denied, and a buzzer alerts  the user. The A key manually locks the door.
